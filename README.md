# A D3 rally

This is a roundup of material about D3 that I assembled while learning it and it serves the purpose of the reference point for code examples when creating some viz. There is a number to each HTML file indicating the logical order in which I've followed the learning.

## Contents

### Sources

Some sources are included here

* D3 version 4.11.0
* C3 version 0.4.18 (warning: not compatible with D3 version 4)

### Tutorials

This folder contains material I generated by using the tutorials listed below.

### Creations

This is the folder where I put all stuff I created for practicing.

* A bubble plot with tooltips

## Materials used

I used a few material around, all the code here is somehow inspired or blatanly taken and edited from there. Here is the list of resources.

### Tutorials

* [dashingd3](https://www.dashingd3js.com/table-of-contents), Sebastian Gutierrez, a classic primer 
* [alignedleft](http://alignedleft.com/tutorials/d3), S Murray, very useful bunch of code examples with explanation
* D3 itself keeps track of a list of tutorials people have written, in [its wiki](https://github.com/d3/d3/wiki/Tutorials)
* [The C3 framework for D3](http://c3js.org/gettingstarted.html#generate)

### Books

## Using D3 in a project

### D3 source code

D3 is open source and [on Github](). When writing this, we used the current release of D3, 4.11.0. To use the library code in a project, you can

* Download it into your project itself (full or minified version), and call it from locally, like this

    ```
    <script type="text/javascript" src="d3_source/4.11.0/d3.min.js"></script>
    ```
 
* Embed the code in the HTML of your project, like this

    ```
    <script src="https://d3js.org/d3.v4.min.js"></script>
    ```

### Using D3 code in HTML- memento

* always put the meta tag in the head as `<meta charset="utf-8">`, as this ensures browser parses D3 right

### Starting a webserver locally

The best way to see the work going is through a local webserver where code is served from your machine. Can start it quickly with Python, for Python3 run

```py
python3 -m http.server
```
